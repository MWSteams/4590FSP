In addition to the vendors I'd suggest seeing if you can get any information from the world's biggest water treatment plants to see what other plants of this scale use for rapid mix. This would include the Cottonwood plant that the Fairmont plant will be eliminating and the LA filtration plant. I don't think that you need to know what the coagulant dose will be or what contaminants will be removed in order to design the rapid mix. The big question is whether the rapid mix is supposed to do something in addition to getting the coagulant equally mixed with water before it divides into multiple treatment trains.)"

        "Our task was to evaluate the process of mechanical rapid mix, methods and strategies to optimize this process, and its purpose and effectiveness as part of the overall water treatment process. In a standard treatment train, rapid mix occurs between coagulant addition and flocculation, and provides an enhanced method of distributing the coagulant evenly through the water. Unfortunately, not much is known about rapid mix and how useful it truly is to the overall treatment train. Therefore our mechanical rapid mix will be aimed to reach a target energy dissipation rate. In turn, we hope that this will result in effectively covering all particles with coagulant. By modifying certain constraints and variables, our goal is to develop code for rapid mix that will accurately predict the turbidity, concentration of dissolved organic matter (DOM), and concentration of arsenic of the water output."
