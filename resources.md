# Fe dose required to remove Arsenic

"Ferric chloride (at an avergae dose of 5.7 mg FeCl3/L) and cationic polymer (at an average dose of 1.7 mg/L) are introduced in the LAA through diffusers at the Cottonwood Treatment Plant." p. 169

"These data can be used to examine the delivery of iron and arsenic to the sedimens and their diagenetic behavior within the sediments. based on 4-yr average values of the arsenic concentration above Cottonwood (24.8 ug/L) and below haiwee (8.3 ug/L) and the ferric chloride dose (5.7 mg/L), the molar ratio of iron to arsenic in the floc is 160. the ame value is observed in theparticulate fraction in the wter samples collected below the LAA discharge." p 170

# Rapid Mix

"While much research remains to be done on the interactions of chemicals, paricles, and mixing, the emerging picture at this point is tha ta high degree of turbulence leads to more efficient chemical use for destabilization by adsorption and charge neutralization, whereas destabilization by precipitation is less sensitive to the mixing conditions." page 546

- from [Benjamin and Lawler](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/8516026) :

Monroe's understanding is that drinking water treatment plants use destabilization by precipitation; the only mechanism that we have been able to replicate in our labs here at Cornell. We now recognize that it isn't destabilization, but rather is simply that the coagulant nanoparticles are sticky.
