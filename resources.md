# Fe dose required to remove Arsenic

Ferric chloride (at an avergae dose of 5.7 mg FeCl3/L) and cationic polymer (at an average dose of 1.7 mg/L) are introduced in the LAA through diffusers at the Cottonwood Treatment Plant. p. 169

These data can be used to examine the delivery of iron and arsenic to the sedimens and their diagenetic behavior within the sediments. based on 4-yr average values of the arsenic concentration above Cottonwood (24.8 ug/L) and below haiwee (8.3 ug/L) and the ferric chloride dose (5.7 mg/L), the molar ratio of iron to arsenic in the floc is 160. the ame value is observed in theparticulate fraction in the wter samples collected below the LAA discharge. p 170
