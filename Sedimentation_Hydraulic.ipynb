The AguaClara team has attempted to operate sedimentation tanks at higher upflow velocities and it is at least possible to operate at higher velocities than the 1 mm/s that AguaClara has used. Kevin has the perfect apparatus for testing this once we have permission to begin research again! Fortunately you can create designs that will respond correctly to changes in the upflow velocity and thus you can make it easy for the client to see what the designs would be for a range of upflow velocities.) \n"

This sedimentation system must be able to treat a design flow of 720 CFS and operate efficiently under a variety of turbidity, arsenic, TOC and emerging contaminant conditions. To complete this task we will need to decide on a set of design variables such as plan view area of the sedimentation tank, the geometry of the tank, upflow velocity, number of treatment trains, depth of the floc blanket, the physics of the diffusers in the resuspension system and the height of the floc hopper, as well as constraints for the plate settlers. With these variables decided we must then confirm that the flocculation-sedimentation system can treat the contaminants to allowable limits for various flow and concentration conditions."
