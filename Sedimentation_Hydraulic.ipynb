The AguaClara team has attempted to operate sedimentation tanks at higher upflow velocities and it is at least possible to operate at higher velocities than the 1 mm/s that AguaClara has used. Kevin has the perfect apparatus for testing this once we have permission to begin research again! Fortunately you can create designs that will respond correctly to changes in the upflow velocity and thus you can make it easy for the client to see what the designs would be for a range of upflow velocities.) \n"

This sedimentation system must be able to treat a design flow of 720 CFS and operate efficiently under a variety of turbidity, arsenic, TOC and emerging contaminant conditions. To complete this task we will need to decide on a set of design variables such as plan view area of the sedimentation tank, the geometry of the tank, upflow velocity, number of treatment trains, depth of the floc blanket, the physics of the diffusers in the resuspension system and the height of the floc hopper, as well as constraints for the plate settlers. With these variables decided we must then confirm that the flocculation-sedimentation system can treat the contaminants to allowable limits for various flow and concentration conditions."

        "In choosing the number of sedimentation units and their size it is important to consider a few constrains. If a plant has many smaller sedimentation units then it would be combersome and inefficient to run them all. However, having smaller units allows operators to more precisly control the upflow velocities in the active sedimentation tanks if the total water demand increases or drops. At the other end of the spectrum, if there is a small number of very large sedimentation units then it would be easier for operators to control those few units. However, if there is a need to take one unit offline then the total production decreases at a higher percent of the total flow than with smaller units. Somewhere in between is the \"ideal\". Based on this notion, we propose the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant use 8 sedimentation units. To find the dimensions of each unit we must define the maximum operating upflow velocity in the sedimentation units. \n",
        "\n",
        "The sedimentation tanks that we are designing are vertical upflow sed tanks that will have a fluidized/suspended bed of flocs in what we call a floc blanket. The upward velocity in the sedimentation tanks will impact whether or not a floc blanket can be formed. If the upflow velocity is too high then only the very large flocs will be captured by the plate settlers, no floc blanket will form, and plant performance will drop below desired. AguaClara designs sedimentation tanks with floc blankets and upflow velocities of 1 mm/s. This design has proven to be very effective at producing effluent turbidities below 1 NTU. Given the design max flow rate of this plant and the space constrictions a higher upflow velocity is considered for sedimentation. In 2015, Casey Garland, a Ph.D. student working on floc blanket research carried out experiments to test if higher Energy Dissipation Rates(EDR) at the injection site of the sedimentation tank affected performance. She carried these lab scale tests out at 1.2 mm/s and 1.6 mm/s upflow velocities with great performance. This is promising because it allows us to increase the maximum upflow velocity from 1mm/s to 1.6 mm/s at the Fairmont plant. \n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the maximum upflow velocity, maximum design flow rate of 720 cubic feet per second, and the number of units we want (8) we calculated each unit would be 40 meters long by 39.8 meters wide. It would perhaps be alright to round the dimensions out to 40 x 40 meters to make the tanks uniform. The total active sedimentation area required for all 8 units is 12,800 square meters. While this is more area than what the Scope of Work alocated for the sedimentation units, 11,850 square meters, we believe it is still feasible. \n",

The first thing we wanted to check was the range of flow rates that this plant could operate in. We are designing the plant so that it could meet all the treatment goals at maximum capacity. However, the plant will operate at a range of different flow rates. To predict if this would be an issue we created code that allowed us to easily find the upflow velocities at different flow rates with different number of sedimentation units online. \n",

There is no evidence suggesting a floc blanket could not form at this slower velocity. However, we were concerned that the reduced flow rate in each tank would make it more difficult for the jet reverser to resuspend settling flocs and as a result begin to fill with sludge. This would be a failure mode and we want to avoid this. \n",
