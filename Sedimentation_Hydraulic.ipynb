To improve the source water quality of the LAAFP and lighten the burden on its filters by building a sedimentation plant upstream, 2. To eliminate the need to operate the Cottonwood Treatment Plant and 3. To mitigate the risk associated with arsenic sediment build up in the North Haiwee Reservoir. The goal of our team’s project is to design a sedimentation system with a floc blanket that can treat arsenic, TOC, and turbidity to allowable limits while maintaining high efficiency and minimizing space requirements at the treatment plant. This sedimentation system must be able to treat a design flow of 720 CFS and operate efficiently under a variety of turbidity, arsenic, TOC and emerging contaminant conditions. To complete this task we will need to decide on a set of design variables such as plan view area of the sedimentation tank, the geometry of the tank, upflow velocity, number of treatment trains, depth of the floc blanket, the physics of the diffusers in the resuspension system and the height of the floc hopper, as well as constraints for the plate settlers. With these variables decided we must then confirm that the flocculation-sedimentation system can treat the contaminants to allowable limits for various flow and concentration conditions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"WoGtXtBGQZr5","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Executive Summary \n","\n","Highlight dominant constraints and your recommendation for the design.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7DztAMPPJhqW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["The sedimentation tank must be able to process a design flow of 720 CFS to be sent to the LAAFP.

The proposed plan view area for the sedimentation tanks is 250' X 510', making maximum upflow velocity of the system 1.7 mm/s, and the surface loading rate is 0.5 gpm/ft^2.

This would include a floc blanket and the bottom geometry used in current AguaClara sedimentation tanks. However, due to the large flow rate required for this plant a few features will be modified to be more efficient with space. We are looking to increase the overall size of each sedimentation unit from the AguaClara standard of 7 meters length and 1 meter width. To do this we will design a sedimentation tank with multiple influent manifolds and jet reversers. We will optimize the overall size and number of manifolds and reversers to reduce the overall footprint and material use. \n","\n","## Manifolds and diffusers \n","One of the important things we need to design are the inlet manifolds and diffusers.

Keeping flow uniform helps prevent undesired circulations in the sedimentation tank which can lead to decreased performance. Additionally, this equation will be important when designing the piping between sedimentation basins.
