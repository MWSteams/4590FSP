        "Our task was to evaluate both processes of mechanical rapid mix and mechanical flocculation, in order to determine the most effective methods for distributing coagulant for mixing and floc formation. In a standard water treatment train, rapid mix occurs between coagulant addition and flocculation, and provides an enhanced method of distributing coagulant evenly through the water. Flocculation is a method to coagulate contaminant particles together for easy removal through sedimentation or filtration, and is an instrumental part of the water treatment train. Our goal is to optimize both treatment processes through modifying parameters such as tank volume, residence time, and flocculator blades, to maximize the amount of contaminant removed through flocculation against maintenance and operation costs."

        "Focusing more specifically on design,  we recommend a pump diffusor as our mechanical rapid-mix mechanism. For mechanical flocculation we will be using rotating blade flocculators. We have not yet determined whether or not we want to implement horizontal or vertical blade flocculators. Regardless of the orientation of the blades, we will compartmentalize the flocculation tank so that a tapered velocity graidnet profile can be imposed. A high to low velocity gradient in subsequent compartments will create dense flocs. It will also reduce the total retention time.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be determining the required rapid-mix volumne by it's residence time. The flocculation tank volume will also be termined by it's residence time; however this volume will be more open ended because the residence time is not necessarily constant.\n",

I suspect that your design will not be influenced in any way by knowing the contaminant that controls the coagulant dosage because we don't have a physics-based model for the design of the rapid mix. See https://aguaclara.github.io/Textbook/Rapid_Mix/RM_Derivations.html#turbulent-large-scale-eddies for mixing length estimates.

We now recognize that it isn't destabilization, but rather is simply that the coagulant nanoparticles are sticky.)\n",
