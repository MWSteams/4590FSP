The report can be strengthen by adding discussion about flow splitting, valves or gates that could be used to turn sections of the plant off for maintenance, and multiple plan view sketches of how channels could deliver water to and extract water from the various units. The end of the semester is coming soon and the amount of effort to date isn't matching the project timeline. There isn't evidence yet that you've thought about flow division. See the hydraulics chapter of the AguaClara textbook. There may also be a section on this in MWH. I found a reference in Chpater 6 Elements of Detailed Designs in Integrated Design and Operation of Water Treatment Facilities by Susumu Kawamua with this advice that includes minimum velocity for sludge. You might also find google maps of large WTPs that would allow you to see how they transfer water to multiple sed tanks.)\n",

        "\n",
        "Simply put, hydraulics involved getting the water through the plant. This task can involve anything from splitting water into different trains to simply getting water into each unit process. This plant is a flocculation and sedimentation plant with gravity powered transport of water. Thus, head calculations are critical to make sure there is enough power to get the water through the plant. The average flow of this plant is around 207 MGD, with a peak flow as high as 465 MGD. Additionally, there will be an addition of coagulation, rapid mix, flocculation and finally sedimentation unit processes. These processes will be constrained to happening one after another in a sequential order so that the water can move through on gravity alone.\n",
        " \n",
        "Conventional treatment practices show that there should be sufficient trains of water so that if part of the plant needs to be shut down for maintenance or cleaning, the whole plant does not need to shut down. Keeping this in mind, a treatment plant should have at least two trains. However, if there are only two trains and one is down, then one train will need to be big enough to hold the capacity of the max flow of the plant, which is not ideal. That is why there should be at least three different flow patterns that water can travel so that one can be down and there will still be two trains left to handle even the peak flow.\n",
        " \n",
        "This can be done in many ways. The first way would be to have three separate trains that are identical in every way. That is, they have the same number of each process. This is hard to do, especially using gravity as the power source, because this would require a lot of space. \n",
        "\n",
        " ![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-oEiGO-Uvdc2MzwP6UFg6JT-jU12HT0u)\n",
        "\n",
        "An additional model could be to add more individual modules to each unit process. For example, this could be two rapid mix units, three flocculators and four sedimentation tanks. So that one rapid mix could be offline without disrupting any of the other unit processes.\n",
        "\n",
        " ![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gr4L6FPkaMUrKfec8dRGqTYjqw3XmIM_)\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the second approach to this design seems to be the best way to do this. So, the goal of the hydraulics team will be to design an open channel, gravity-powered flow from the start to the end where each process will have the water split into it and then brought back together to be distributed into the next unit process. For rapid mix this would mean allowing the water to flow into different channels at the start of the plant that can be closed off to flow when that rapid mix is offline. For flocculation, this will mean taking the water from the rapid mix and having it enter flocculators so that any flocculators can be blocked of flow when they are offline. In the sedimentation tanks, the flow will go down a large open channel with outlets into each sedimentation tank and each of those outlets can be blocked if the sedimentation tank is offline. At the end of the sedimentation tanks, the water will flow into another open channel so that at the end of the plant all of the water enters one final channel then can flow into the reservoir.\n",

        "# Major Decisions\n",
        "\n",
        "The first major decision is to think about the treatment trains. How many trains will the plant have? And, what is the most effective way to have trains so that the least amount of processes would need to be shut down? To answer this the decision was made to effectively only have one train. That is, have each single unit of the unit process be able to be offline without any other downstream process needing to be offline. This is the best way to go about this but does also bring up some other rather large decisions.\n",
        " \n",
        "The next major decision that needs to be made is how big can these channels be. This plant is rated to move a lot of water through its processes and therefore will require some large channels. This will take up a lot of space and can also cause serious construction limitations. The strategy to come to a choice is to do some preliminary calculations and then also add in how many of each process we will have. Then we can add or subtract from there. To get this information we will need to look at the preliminary designs from each team.\n",
        " \n",
        "Another big decision that needs to be made is how to take a treatment train or unit process offline. Once again, since there are large flows involved in this plant simple valves may not be strong enough to stop the flow out of the channel. References from other plants this size will be needed so that we can gauge all options. We can also design what we think will work then address its feasibility with others.\n",
        " \n",
        "In order to get the water from open channels to multiple sedimentation tanks, using a large channel with outlets to each tank seems to be the best option. However doing this will lead to a large plan view area for these channels. There is not a lot of space for this plant so having a large area taken up by these channels may not work for construction purposes. Moving forward, the area of these channels will be calculated and compared to the area of the rest of the plant to see just how much space will be taken up. Additionally, further research will be done into how to make the plan view area of these tanks smaller whether that is making them deeper or potentially having a couple channels.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Next Steps and Challenges\n",
        "\n",
        "Next steps are to continue to get data needed from each of the unit processes so that our design may be furthered or edited as needed. We will also need to figure out the best way to take a train offline and cut-off these large flows from the process. This is also a major challenge because indications are that a simple valve may not be big or strong enough to handle the flows of the plant. Additionally, the dimensions of these channels will need to be kept in mind. At the end of the day we could end up with big enough channels to account for more than half of the area of the plant and that would not be ideal. So, we will need to check these dimensions and adjust certain parameters so that they are not that large in comparison. This is also a challenge because these channels cannot be such that particles start to settle out and block potential flow. We also have the challenge of the size such that channels for sedimentation tanks will become overly large and not be feasible to construct or maintain."
