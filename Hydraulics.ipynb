    "\n",
    "Hydraulics involves getting the water through the plant. This will involve the necessary design criteria to split the water to the different trains of flows we have. The main basis for design will be finding the right size and ways to split the water so that each of the trains will be able to be in use. The tricky parts of this task will be coordinating with each team so that flows are feasible into each of the parts of each process. Some of the processes might need the water to be split more ways than others so using conservation of mass will be key in this task. "
