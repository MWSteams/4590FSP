        "Rapid mix is used to mix adhesive nanoparticles uniformly with the raw water, which is especially important if the flow is split between two treatment trains. Rapid mixing also ensures nanoparticles do not self aggregate into microclusters, and that nanoparticles are distributed evenly and uniformly between particles.\n",

        "Energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant. Due to high energy consumption, in many cases, the amount of energy used is not practical for gravity-powered water treatment plants. The turbulent eddies in rapid mixing cause stretching and thinning of the concentration gradients, and expansions create energy dissipation that decrease with distance downstream. Intensity of turbulence is characterized by the rate at which mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy, or the mean flow through eddies and viscosity where kinetic energy is converted into heat. \n",

        "The compelling reason for rapid mix is for prior to the flow splitting into multiple treatment trains.

The RPME process design equations will include design considerations such as inner viscous scale to gauge turbulence, energy dissipation rate for determination of height difference within mixing tanks, flow expansion to determine appropriate sizes and velocities of tank entrances and exits and influent water. Finally, our analysis will include designs for physical access to the rapid mixing basins, and an outline of operation requirements for harnessing the potential energy of the influent.\n",

The RMPE team must balance its goal of harnessing the potential energy of water to power the rapid mixing process with the constraint of maximum head loss alloted for the plant.

        "The RPME team will continued to develop models for open-channel flow mixing (both single and multiple channel flow) and for the hydraulic jump.  The hydraulic jump may present a challenge due to the limited headloss available in the design constraints; however, the team will still perform an analysis of this option.  It is key to develop more graphs that show performance as a function of flow rate to help determine the appropriate number of channels.\n",

        "[/Monroe/]: # (What are the physics of the AguaClara design and what might that look like at FSP scale? Why would you use a Venturi given that it is designed to minimize head loss and you want to generate turbulence?)\n",

        "[/Dominic/]: # (We are no longer considering the use of a Venturi or the Agua Clara design for the Rapid Mix process.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to further development of models (which now have a basic structure), the RMPE team will begin collecting data on vendors and contact information.  While for the open channels the construction will mostly be concrete shaping of the channel, the hydraulic jump may require research as to the appropriate geometry. "

        "Below are some prelinary calculations estimating the power dissipation in a hydraulic jump (given maximum flow).  The influent Froude number was chosen on 9 based on a Portland State University study citing this as number within a range for high levels of mixing (more research needs to be done to determine the optimal number).  V2 (velocity after the jump) was chosen arbitrarily.  The number \"1\" refers to flow before the jump and \"2\" refers to flow after the jump. More modeling is required to determine the headloss incurred by the hydraulic jump, the number of channels which should be present in the design, and the degree of mixing which is attained. "
