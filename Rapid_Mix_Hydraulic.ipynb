While traditional mixing systems are mechanically operated- requiring large energy inputs, the RMPE team proposes harnessing the potential energy of influent water to achieve thorough blending of coagulant nanoparticles."

        "# **Executive Summary**\n",
        "\n",
        "Rapid mix is used to mix adhesive nanoparticles uniformly with the raw water, which is especially important if the flow is split between two treatment trains. Rapid mixing also ensures nanoparticles do not self aggregate into microclusters, and that nanoparticles are distributed evenly and uniformly between particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant. Due to high energy consumption, in many cases, the amount of energy used is not practical for gravity-powered water treatment plants. The turbulent eddies in rapid mixing cause stretching and thinning of the concentration gradients, and expansions create energy dissipation that decrease with distance downstream. Intensity of turbulence is characterized by the rate at which mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy, or the mean flow through eddies and viscosity where kinetic energy is converted into heat. \n",
        "\n",
        "The electricity cost for mechanized rapid mix can be up to 1.5 million USD over 25 years for a package plant that uses 400J/L. A 100L/s AguaClara plant costs up to $1,000,000. Therefore, we analyze hydraulic rapid mix as a more efficient and cost effective alternative. The compelling reason for rapid mix is for prior to the flow splitting into multiple treatment trains. We aim to determine the optimal number of mixing units in order to maintain a distribution of coagulant that is sufficient for managing the influent water of a potential energy system at the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant. \n",
        "\n",
        "RPME takes into account the design constraints outlined in the FSP Scope of Work Document, including gravity flow operations without the use of water pumps, mixing basins constrained to expected flows through the FSP, as well as the constraint of the treatment train design outlined by the LAAWTP engineers. RPME will also minimize the number of chemical storage tanks and mixing tanks necessary to minimize capital, electric, and operational costs. The RPME process design equations will include design considerations such as inner viscous scale to gauge turbulence, energy dissipation rate for determination of height difference within mixing tanks, flow expansion to determine appropriate sizes and velocities of tank entrances and exits and influent water. Finally, our analysis will include designs for physical access to the rapid mixing basins, and an outline of operation requirements for harnessing the potential energy of the influent.\n"

        "According to the FSP Scope of Work Document, FSP will be operated via gravity flow from both LAA1 and LAA2; therefore, the RMPE team will not consider the use of water pumps in its design.  Additionally, the estimated maximum head loss throughout the entirety of the plant is 2 feet.  The RMPE team must balance its goal of harnessing the potential energy of water to power the rapid mixing process with the constraint of maximum head loss alloted for the plant.  This will require the RMPE team to consider the expected head loss for downstream processes as estimated by the hydraulics subteam.\n",
        "\n",
        "The RMPE team must design the mixing basins such that they are functional given the minimum and maximum (720 cfs) expected flows through FSP.  Based upon the last 10 years of available water quality data, the average flow is 320 cfs, so the RMPE team will use 320 cfs as its optimal design parameter for flow.  The flow design flow through each mixing unit is also dependent on the number of proposed treatment trains.  This quantity will be determined to optimize each unit process.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Another design constraint is that the rapid mix tanks will be directly after coarse screening and before the flocculation/sedimentation tanks.  The treatment train design has already been laid out by the LAAWTP engineers.\n",

        "The exact dimensions of the project have yet to be determined; however, it is within the spatial interests of FSP to minimize the number of chemical storage tanks necessary.  As each mixing tank requires its own chemical feed line, the RMPE team aims to minimize the number of mixing tanks which are necessary.  Additionally, the RMPE team will report the expected plan view area for the mixing tanks so that it can be accounted for in overall plant design and changed in future design iterations if too large. \n",

        "In the FSP Scope of Work Document, the rate for cubic yards of concrete is placed at 300 USD/CY.  The RMPE team will estimate the expected capital cost (rough estimate) for the number of rapid mix tanks proposed.  Additionally, energy costs are 0.11 USD/kWh at this site.

        "\n",

        "\t\n",
        "3. *Flow Expansion Minor Head Loss:* minor head loss is related to change in flow geometry as opposed to major head loss (which is related to shear at solid boundaries). Since the rapid mixing units aim to convert mechanical energy to thermal energy, it is necessary to increase minor head loss where possible.  As minor losses are produced by flow expansions, the RMPE team must calculate these losses.  This equation will assist RMPE in determining the appropriate areas for tank entrance and exit as well as the approach velocity of influent water. \n",

RMPE can use this metric to evaluate the degree of blending which occurs under various design scenarios.  While there is not data for this specific project, this statistic could be applied to analogous rapid mix units which are currently operating.  The general description of how completely the streams have been blended can be put the following way:\n",
