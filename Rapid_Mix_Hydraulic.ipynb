As you gain more experience you will use the early exploration to very quickly check feasibility so you know whether or not to continue exploring that option. For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

        "\n",
        "Rapid mix is used to mix adhesive nanoparticles uniformly with the raw water, which is especially important if the flow is split between two treatment trains. Rapid mixing also ensures nanoparticles do not self aggregate into microclusters, and that nanoparticles are distributed evenly and uniformly between particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant. Due to high energy consumption, in many cases, the amount of energy used is not practical for gravity-powered water treatment plants. The turbulent eddies in rapid mixing cause stretching and thinning of the concentration gradients, and expansions create energy dissipation that decrease with distance downstream. Intensity of turbulence is characterized by the rate at which mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy, or the mean flow through eddies and viscosity where kinetic energy is converted into heat. \n",
        "\n",
        "The compelling reason for rapid mix is for prior to the flow splitting into multiple treatment trains. We aim to determine the optimal number of mixing units in order to maintain a distribution of coagulant that is sufficient for managing the influent water of a potential energy system at the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant. \n",

RPME will also minimize the number of chemical storage tanks and mixing tanks necessary to minimize capital, electric, and operational costs. The RPME process design equations will include design considerations such as inner viscous scale to gauge turbulence, energy dissipation rate for determination of height difference within mixing tanks, flow expansion to determine appropriate sizes and velocities of tank entrances and exits and influent water.

RMPE can use this metric to evaluate the degree of blending which occurs under various design scenarios.  While there is not data for this specific project, this statistic could be applied to analogous rapid mix units which are currently operating.  The general description of how completely the streams have been blended can be put the following way:\n",
        "\n",
        "  $Is = [\\frac{sigma(m)}{simga(u)}]^2$\n",
        "\n",
        "  simga(m) = standard deviation of concentration in blended stream\n",
        "\n",
        "  simga(u) = standard deviation between two streams in unblended condition\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Is = 1, the two streams are completely unblended\n",
        "  *   Is = 0, the two streams are completely blended\n",

        "1. **Open-Channel Flow** this is the design in which there are open channels (one for each flocculator) with a single contraction/expansion.  Over the expansion there will be a dispersed chemical input.  It is likely we will not be able to achieve the target retention time in this model as the length scale is larger. Design needs to be renovated to solve for time (target of t = 0.3s) given the length scale.\n",
        "2. **Hydraulic Jump** The calculations below show that the head loss is reasonable if the channel width is wide enough.  This is not likely to be the most efficient design; however, calculations will be completed to present it as a possibility.  There have been some technical, python difficulties here which have slowed progress.  \n",
        "3.  **Open-Channel with Pillars** (NOT STARTED) In this design, each flocculator has an open-channel rapid mix tank with pillars in it.  These pillars will be the site of chemical injection.  Calculations need to be done to find the appropriate spacing of pillars.\n",
        "4. **Open-Channel with Mesh** (NOT STARTED - PENDING) We may not get to this design.  Currently, the idea is that there will be a mesh (to create many small jets) over which there will be an injection.  This is difficult because the injection cannot be in the middle of each of the jets created by the holes in the mesh.  "

You can't arbitrarily set the time over which that energy is dissipated as you've done here by saying it will take 0.3 seconds. That energy is dissipated in the resulting jets and the cascade of eddies down to the inner viscous length scale. We do have equations that allow you to calculate the maximum energy dissipation rate in a jet. However, that isn't completely helpful either because we'd like to have uniform mixing and we are most worried about regions in the channel where the energy dissipation rate is low.
