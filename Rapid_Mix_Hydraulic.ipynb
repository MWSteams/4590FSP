As you gain more experience you will use the early exploration to very quickly check feasibility so you know whether or not to continue exploring that option. For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

        "\n",
        "Rapid mix is used to mix adhesive nanoparticles uniformly with the raw water, which is especially important if the flow is split between two treatment trains. Rapid mixing also ensures nanoparticles do not self aggregate into microclusters, and that nanoparticles are distributed evenly and uniformly between particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant. Due to high energy consumption, in many cases, the amount of energy used is not practical for gravity-powered water treatment plants. The turbulent eddies in rapid mixing cause stretching and thinning of the concentration gradients, and expansions create energy dissipation that decrease with distance downstream. Intensity of turbulence is characterized by the rate at which mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy, or the mean flow through eddies and viscosity where kinetic energy is converted into heat. \n",
        "\n",
        "The compelling reason for rapid mix is for prior to the flow splitting into multiple treatment trains. We aim to determine the optimal number of mixing units in order to maintain a distribution of coagulant that is sufficient for managing the influent water of a potential energy system at the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant. \n",

RPME will also minimize the number of chemical storage tanks and mixing tanks necessary to minimize capital, electric, and operational costs. The RPME process design equations will include design considerations such as inner viscous scale to gauge turbulence, energy dissipation rate for determination of height difference within mixing tanks, flow expansion to determine appropriate sizes and velocities of tank entrances and exits and influent water.

RMPE can use this metric to evaluate the degree of blending which occurs under various design scenarios.  While there is not data for this specific project, this statistic could be applied to analogous rapid mix units which are currently operating.  The general description of how completely the streams have been blended can be put the following way:\n",
        "\n",
        "  $Is = [\\frac{sigma(m)}{simga(u)}]^2$\n",
        "\n",
        "  simga(m) = standard deviation of concentration in blended stream\n",
        "\n",
        "  simga(u) = standard deviation between two streams in unblended condition\n",
        "\n",
        "  *   Is = 1, the two streams are completely unblended\n",
        "  *   Is = 0, the two streams are completely blended\n",

        "1. **Open-Channel Flow** this is the design in which there are open channels (one for each flocculator) with a single contraction/expansion.  Over the expansion there will be a dispersed chemical input.  It is likely we will not be able to achieve the target retention time in this model as the length scale is larger. Design needs to be renovated to solve for time (target of t = 0.3s) given the length scale.\n",
        "2. **Hydraulic Jump** The calculations below show that the head loss is reasonable if the channel width is wide enough.  This is not likely to be the most efficient design; however, calculations will be completed to present it as a possibility.  There have been some technical, python difficulties here which have slowed progress.  \n",
        "3.  **Open-Channel with Pillars** (NOT STARTED) In this design, each flocculator has an open-channel rapid mix tank with pillars in it.  These pillars will be the site of chemical injection.  Calculations need to be done to find the appropriate spacing of pillars.\n",
        "4. **Open-Channel with Mesh** (NOT STARTED - PENDING) We may not get to this design.  Currently, the idea is that there will be a mesh (to create many small jets) over which there will be an injection.  This is difficult because the injection cannot be in the middle of each of the jets created by the holes in the mesh.  "

        "Below are some prelinary calculations estimating the power dissipation in a hydraulic jump (given maximum flow).  The influent Froude number was chosen on 4.5 based on a Portland State University study citing this as number the lowest Froude number supporting fully developed hydraulic jump.  V2 (velocity after the jump) was chosen arbitrarily.  The number \"1\" refers to flow before the jump and \"2\" refers to flow after the jump. More modeling is required to determine the headloss incurred by the hydraulic jump, the number of channels which should be present in the design, and the degree of mixing which is attained. \n",
        "\n",
        "[/Monroe/]: # (I think it will take a lot of energy to create a hydraulic jump and am not convinced that it is a good option. Can you calculate the minimum energy required to create a hydraulic jump? - Okay I added the print statement below where you calculated the change in Energy Grade Line and got 37 m. Confirms that we might have a problem with hydraulic jumps. You could calculate the minimum energy that you could use to create a hydraulic jump and possibly demonstrate that it isn't viable.  It is SOOOO important to calculate the parmeters that connect with the constraints.)\n",

        "[/Dominic/]: # (Okay, I will try and demonstrate that it is not a viable option.  I was just trying to explore different.  I will use a lower Froude number.  Before, I had used the highests recommended Froude number) \n",
        "\n",
        "[/Monroe/]: # (It is not a good practice to redefine constants and to create multiple copies of variables that have the same value. Why not simple use fmt.q_max in your code? Certainly don't keep on redefining gravity.)\n",

        "\n",
        "[/Dominic/]: # (Okay! I am trying to make a graph of minimum required headloss to maintain a hydraulic jump as a function of channel width.  Since the number of hydraulic jump channels will be determined by the number of treatment trains determined optimal for flocculation, channel width is the variable design parameter.  Once the optimal width of channels given maximum flow rate is found, I will determine the minimum headloss required to maintain a hydraulic jump. Finally, I will create a graph of minimum headloss required-given the already calculated channel width- as a function of flow rate through the plant.  This will give us a good idea of range of possible headloss requirements under different flow rates.  It is possible that this could be viable- given wide channel widths; however, it will be dependent on available plan area.  Plan area will be calculated last)\n",

As you gain more experience you will use the early exploration to very quickly check feasibility so you know whether or not to continue exploring that option. For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

        "Flocculation is widely used in water treatment because of the use of sedimentation to remove particles from the water. Flocculation aims to increase the diameter of the particles through applying coagulant during rapid mix.Hydraulic flocculators use a series of baffles in order to generate mixing. In hydraulic flocculation, in order to facilitate particle collisions, we must design a flocculator that takes into account collision potential and energy dissipation rate.\n",
