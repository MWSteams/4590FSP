As you gain more experience you will use the early exploration to very quickly check feasibility so you know whether or not to continue exploring that option. For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

The goal of rapid mix is to mix coagulant nanoparticle- ferric chloride in this case- with influent raw water.  After rapid mix, the particles continue to aggregate during flocculation- forming floccs. This step allows for particle removal in sedimentation and/or filtration.  The designs below aim to minimize cost and plan view area and maximize performance metrics while complying with client expectations and constraints. \n",

        "\n",
        "The hydraulic rapid mix and the flocculator employ many of the same physics principles in the basis of their designs.  In each unit process, energy dissipation rates and velocity gradients from head loss are responsible for the coagulation and flocculation which lead to flocc development.  In hydraulic rapid mix, the main parameter used to gauge effectiveness is the mixing time.  Mixing time is important in a rapid mix unit because when coagulant is first added to the raw water, self-aggregation between coagulant nanoparticles can occur if the mixing time is too long.  The main parameter in the hydraulic flocculator is the velocity gradient which is achieved by the head loss as water is directed around baffles. \n",
        "\n",
        "The hydraulic rapid mix design our team chose was one in which round pillars are placed in an open channel (we will refer to this as obstructed open channel flow). In obstructed open channel flow, the pillars create head loss and eddies which in turn generate the energy dissipation and large-scale mixing required in rapid mix.  This report also considers the use of a hydraulic jump and an open channel with a single flow expansion (diagram below) to carry out rapid mix; however, both were discarded on account of not complying with project constraints and goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The hydraulic flocculation model chosen by our team is based on the Agua Clara model; however, it operates with horizontal flow as opposed to vertical flow. The horizontal flow model makes the flocculator more efficient given the scale of this project and easier for use.  Only one design was create for the hydraulic flocculator, but it generates an excel spreadsheet comparing design parameters and outputs for different numbers of treatment trains. Deciding the optimal number of treatment trains was a major question for this desing.  For the rapid mix units, there will be a single rapid mix channel corresponding to each flocculator.  In deciding the depth for the flocculator (which also determines the depth of the rapid mix units), a large consideration was the plan view area available.  According to the FSP Scope of Work Document, there was a 200ft x 125ft area set aside for flocculation. \n",
        "\n",
        "The energy input for a traditional rapid mix/flocculation unit process can be extremely high; the energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant.  It is our hope that the hydraulic designs for rapid mix and flocculation will boost the energy efficiency of the FSP plant.  With only 2 ft of available head loss for the FSP project, many tradeoffs had to be considered in the following desings. \n",

In order to achieve this goal, it is recommended that the blending time for Ferric Chloride nanoparticles not exceed 0.3s (MWH textbook). According to the Agua Clara, \"we don’t yet have any experimental evidence that rapid mixing is important and it is quite likely that the energy dissipation rate found in the hydraulic flocculator is sufficient to provide the required mixing\" (Agua Clara).  Nevertheless, the standard for mixing time will be used as a target goal for the RMPE team's rapid mix design.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1.   The Hydraulic Jump Rapid Mix design is not appropriate for this treatment plant because the minimum head loss requirement (1.243 m) exceeds the alloted head loss for the entire plant.\n",
        "2.   The Single Expansion Open Channel desing (diagram below) is not appropriate for this treatment plant because the eddy length scale is too large.  This means that the best achievable mixing time (t_eddy) is 1.01 seconds.  This is over 3 times as large as the target mixing time.\n",
        "3. The Obstructed Open Channel Flow design was ultimately chosen as the proposed hydraulic rapid mix method.  Its best mixing time (under maximum flow conditions) is 0.25 seconds.  The worst case scenario mixing time (when the minimum flow is split between two rapid mix channels) is 2.62 seconds.  While this exceeds the target mixing time considerably, there was a tradeoff between the worst case scenario mixing time and the space available; more pillars and more injection portals would have had to be added to the channels (to make smaller eddy length scales) which would congest the already tight space (the channel is only 1.4 m wide).\n",
        "4. It was determined that there will be 46 injection portals in each of the channels.  There will be 4 pillars and these injection portals will be vertically distributed along the axis of symmetry between pillars. The total plan view area of the rapid mix will be 16.16 m^2. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Next Steps and Challenges**\n",
        "\n",
        "One challenge of this design is that the number of injection portals recommended for each channel is not necessarily divisable by the number of pillars in that channel.  This means that there may either be too many or too few injection portals in some of the columns of flow in between pillars.  Further work would need to be done to calculate new mixing time and eddy length scale values based on a new number of injection portals per channel that is divisable by the number of pillars.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another design challenge is to determine what the injection portal apparatus will look like.  There were no findings by this team, but it would be important to calculate the expected additional head loss created by the injection portal appartus itself.  This may complicate eddy formation and affect the mixing time. Furthermore, the injection portal apparatus' tubing will create additional headloss, so it would be important to factor this head loss into the overall head loss availalbe for this plant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, there is very little known about rapid mix and whether or not it is actually necessary in a treatmet plant (Agua Clara).  Much of the mixing which occurs may naturally occur in the flocculator.  In order to determine whether the mixing time of  0.3s is a firm goal or not, more studies need to be conducted.   "

        "Below are some prelinary calculations estimating the power dissipation in a hydraulic jump (given maximum flow).  The influent Froude number was chosen on 4.5 based on a Portland State University study citing this as number the lowest Froude number supporting fully developed hydraulic jump.  V2 (velocity after the jump) was chosen arbitrarily.  The number \"1\" refers to flow before the jump and \"2\" refers to flow after the jump. More modeling is required to determine the headloss incurred by the hydraulic jump, the number of channels which should be present in the design, and the degree of mixing which is attained. \n",
        "\n",
        "[/Monroe/]: # (I think it will take a lot of energy to create a hydraulic jump and am not convinced that it is a good option. Can you calculate the minimum energy required to create a hydraulic jump? - Okay I added the print statement below where you calculated the change in Energy Grade Line and got 37 m. Confirms that we might have a problem with hydraulic jumps. You could calculate the minimum energy that you could use to create a hydraulic jump and possibly demonstrate that it isn't viable.  It is SOOOO important to calculate the parmeters that connect with the constraints.)\n",
        "\n",
        "[/Dominic/]: # (Okay, I will try and demonstrate that it is not a viable option.  I was just trying to explore different.  I will use a lower Froude number.  Before, I had used the highests recommended Froude number) \n",
        "\n",
        "[/Monroe/]: # (It is not a good practice to redefine constants and to create multiple copies of variables that have the same value. Why not simple use fmt.q_max in your code? Certainly don't keep on redefining gravity.)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "[/Dominic/]: # (Okay! I am trying to make a graph of minimum required headloss to maintain a hydraulic jump as a function of channel width.  Since the number of hydraulic jump channels will be determined by the number of treatment trains determined optimal for flocculation, channel width is the variable design parameter.  Once the optimal width of channels given maximum flow rate is found, I will determine the minimum headloss required to maintain a hydraulic jump. Finally, I will create a graph of minimum headloss required-given the already calculated channel width- as a function of flow rate through the plant.  This will give us a good idea of range of possible headloss requirements under different flow rates.  It is possible that this could be viable- given wide channel widths; however, it will be dependent on available plan area.  Plan area will be calculated last)\n",

As you gain more experience you will use the early exploration to very quickly check feasibility so you know whether or not to continue exploring that option. For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

In hydraulic flocculation, in order to facilitate particle collisions, we must design a flocculator that takes into account collision potential and energy dissipation rate.\n",
