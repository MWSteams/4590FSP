As you gain more experience you will use the early exploration to very quickly check feasibility so you know whether or not to continue exploring that option. For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

        "\n",
        "Rapid mix is used to mix adhesive nanoparticles uniformly with the raw water, which is especially important if the flow is split between two treatment trains. Rapid mixing also ensures nanoparticles do not self aggregate into microclusters, and that nanoparticles are distributed evenly and uniformly between particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant. Due to high energy consumption, in many cases, the amount of energy used is not practical for gravity-powered water treatment plants. The turbulent eddies in rapid mixing cause stretching and thinning of the concentration gradients, and expansions create energy dissipation that decrease with distance downstream. Intensity of turbulence is characterized by the rate at which mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy, or the mean flow through eddies and viscosity where kinetic energy is converted into heat. \n",
        "\n",
        "The compelling reason for rapid mix is for prior to the flow splitting into multiple treatment trains. We aim to determine the optimal number of mixing units in order to maintain a distribution of coagulant that is sufficient for managing the influent water of a potential energy system at the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant. \n",

RPME will also minimize the number of chemical storage tanks and mixing tanks necessary to minimize capital, electric, and operational costs. The RPME process design equations will include design considerations such as inner viscous scale to gauge turbulence, energy dissipation rate for determination of height difference within mixing tanks, flow expansion to determine appropriate sizes and velocities of tank entrances and exits and influent water. Finally, our analysis will include designs for physical access to the rapid mixing basins, and an outline of operation requirements for harnessing the potential energy of the influent.\n",

According to the Agua Clara, \"we don’t yet have any experimental evidence that rapid mixing is important and it is quite likely that the energy dissipation rate found in the hydraulic flocculator is sufficient to provide the required mixing\" (Agua Clara).

        "There are now 4 working designs to work on:\n",
        "1. **Open-Channel Flow** this is the design in which there are open channels (one for each flocculator) with a single contraction/expansion.  Over the expansion there will be a dispersed chemical input.  It is likely we will not be able to achieve the target retention time in this model as the length scale is larger. Design needs to be renovated to solve for time (target of t = 0.3s) given the length scale.\n",
        "2. **Hydraulic Jump** The calculations below show that the head loss is reasonable if the channel width is wide enough.  This is not likely to be the most efficient design; however, calculations will be completed to present it as a possibility.  There have been some technical, python difficulties here which have slowed progress.  \n",
        "3.  **Open-Channel with Pillars** (NOT STARTED) In this design, each flocculator has an open-channel rapid mix tank with pillars in it.  These pillars will be the site of chemical injection.  Calculations need to be done to find the appropriate spacing of pillars.\n",
        "4. **Open-Channel with Mesh** (NOT STARTED - PENDING) We may not get to this design.  Currently, the idea is that there will be a mesh (to create many small jets) over which there will be an injection.  This is difficult because the injection cannot be in the middle of each of the jets created by the holes in the mesh.  "

For the hydraulic jump the question is whether their is enough energy available to power a hydraulic jump. Your first design suggests you might have a real problem! But that is great. Check to see if you made any bad assumptions about water depths and if this is the minimum amount of energy that is needed by a hydrualic jump, then you document that including equations in Latex and then move on to a more energy efficiency design. In this case you need to use less energy and thus the maximum velocity in the constricted flow must be MUCH lower.) \n",

        "Flocculation is widely used in water treatment because of the use of sedimentation to remove particles from the water. Flocculation aims to increase the diameter of the particles through applying coagulant during rapid mix. In order to facilitate particle collisions, we must design a flocculator that takes into account collision potential and energy dissipation rate.\n",

        "\n",
        "# Critical Design Criteria\n",
        "Our input parameters for our hydraulic flocculator design are number of treatment trains, flow rate, turbidity, downstream height.\n",
        "These are the priorities that we will base the rest of the design around.\n",
        "\n",
        "[/Cynthia/]: # (is this maximum flow rate / turbidity?)\n",
        "\n",
        "Physical dimensions: We will calculate the length of the channel, amount of channels, and actual channel width.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hydraulic parameters: He, distance between baffle/obstacle induced flow expansions, nobstacles - amount of obstacles per baffle space, and S- baffle spacing (distance between baffles).\n",

        "[Include diagram & equations used]\n",
        "\n",
        "Output parameters we will calculate are plan view area of the flocculator, length of the channels, width of the channel, width of each baffle, and spacing between the baffles.\n",
        "In our analysis, we will take into account the number of treatment trains, variation of flow rates, turbidity, and downstream H of the flocculation tank. In our design, we will use a horizontal hydraulic flocculator. We will use a residence time of 7.5 minutes, minimum width of 4 meters, and a flow rate of 720 cubic feet per second.\n",

We can use the stream gauge data to get the water temperature and averages for a certain number of years. We will run three different water temperatures for the flocculator, a minimum, maximum, and average. We will analyze the variation in number of treatment trains.\n",
