        "Rapid mix is used to mix adhesive nanoparticles uniformly with the raw water, which is especially important if the flow is split between two treatment trains. Rapid mixing also ensures nanoparticles do not self aggregate into microclusters, and that nanoparticles are distributed evenly and uniformly between particles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Energy invested for rapid mixing processes is significant. Due to high energy consumption, in many cases, the amount of energy used is not practical for gravity-powered water treatment plants. The turbulent eddies in rapid mixing cause stretching and thinning of the concentration gradients, and expansions create energy dissipation that decrease with distance downstream. Intensity of turbulence is characterized by the rate at which mechanical energy is lost to thermal energy, or the mean flow through eddies and viscosity where kinetic energy is converted into heat. \n",

        "The compelling reason for rapid mix is for prior to the flow splitting into multiple treatment trains. We aim to determine the optimal number of mixing units in order to maintain a distribution of coagulant that is sufficient for managing the influent water of a potential energy system at the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant. \n",

The RPME process design equations will include design considerations such as inner viscous scale to gauge turbulence, energy dissipation rate for determination of height difference within mixing tanks, flow expansion to determine appropriate sizes and velocities of tank entrances and exits and influent water.

The RMPE team must balance its goal of harnessing the potential energy of water to power the rapid mixing process with the constraint of maximum head loss alloted for the plant.
