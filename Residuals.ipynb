The preliminary evaluation suggests using equalization basins, rapid mixers, then settling tanks, and introducing coagulants to form and settle out thickened solids. The residual solids will then be further mechanically dewatered at a separate facility, then can be temporarily stored in a sludge hopper (with the capacity to store a minimum of a week’s worth of sludge) before they are transferred via truck to be disposed off-site. The leftover water will be recycled to the head of the Fairmont sedimentation plant. \n",

        "A preliminary evaluation has concluded that that centrifuges are most effective active dewatering technology. We will develop a design for the thickening facility and dewatering facility and evaluate their cost and effectiveness. Our thickening facility will take the collected sludge and thicken it, and also even out the flow before the sludge before it enters the dewatering facility. These are expected to be similar to the coagulation and flocculation tanks. The dewatering facility will be composed of centrifuges that will further dewater the sludge to create a sludge cake. There also must be a distribution mechanism for the sludge cake to be moved out of the facility.\n",

The treatment processes examined were thickening, conditioning, and dewatering, which all serve to decrease the water composition of sludge. Gravity thickeners utilize electricty in order to rotate sludge scrapers at the bottom of the tank, while centifuges require electricty to run their electric motor. From this study, it was found that gravity thickening required 0.0019-0.0021 Kwh m^-3 for plants that serve over 50,000 people, while thickening centrigues required 0.015-0.035 kWh m^-3. At Beijung's Gaobeidian WWTP, sludge thickening accounts for 0.04% of the plant's energy consumption.

This leftover water should be recycled back into the front end of the plant. Also, considering what to do with the residuals can be difficult due to limited space availability of dumping in Los Angeles. Another challenge includes finding safe ways to deal with Arsenic in the residuals, since it is a hazardous waste, and presents itself in high concentrations through the plant inflow. The management of liquid waste streams is also going to be challenging, as our team will try to recycle as much water as possible, and the constituents in the return flow are difficult to manage. \n",
        "\n",
        "Next Steps include contacting the other teams to decide which treatment trains we should focus on removing residuals from, and researching more on the types of contaminants in typical inflow waters in the area. This could help our team in determining what types of chemicals and processes will be used in getting rid of contaminants, and the amount of residual flows we will need to focus on. \n",
        "We also will need to research the regulatory standards out in place for the contaminants we will be working to remove, in order to understand how and where they can be disposed of. \n",
        "Another large part of our next steps includes researching methods of equations for mass of wastes, figure out who manufacturers are of units that process the solids, and suggest centrifuges. A reasonable task might be to look at the top options for consolidating solids in addition to centrifuges, see if we agree that using a centrifuge for dewatering is the top choice. We want to identify the \"why\" of the  technology approach.\n",
