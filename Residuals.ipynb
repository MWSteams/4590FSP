        "Our goal is to develop a complete analysis of the composition, management, and disposal of residuals from the proposed treatment process.\n",
        "According to the Fairmont Treatment Plant’s Scope Of Work document, settled solids from the sedimentation process will be mechanically thickened in an on site facility. The preliminary evaluation suggests using equalization basins, rapid mixers, then settling tanks, and introducing coagulants to form and settle out thickened solids. The residual solids will then be further mechanically dewatered at a separate facility, then can be temporarily stored in a sludge hopper (with the capacity to store a minimum of a week’s worth of sludge) before they are transferred via truck to be disposed off-site. The leftover water will be recycled to the head of the Fairmont sedimentation plant. \n",
        "\n",
        "A preliminary evaluation has concluded that that centrifuges are most effective active dewatering technology. We will develop a design for the thickening facility and dewatering facility and evaluate their cost and effectiveness. Our thickening facility will take the collected sludge and thicken it, and also even out the flow before the sludge before it enters the dewatering facility. These are expected to be similar to the coagulation and flocculation tanks. The dewatering facility will be composed of centrifuges that will further dewater the sludge to create a sludge cake. There also must be a distribution mechanism for the sludge cake to be moved out of the facility.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will also develop a more exact estimate of the expected residual output of the process, and determine a minimum capacity for our residual treatment train.\n",

        "### Sludge Composition\n",
        "We can determine the sludge composition based on estimates of the treatment dosages from Fairmont Sedimentation Plant Scope of Work document and the other teams. We calculated the average dose of polymer using the yearly amount of 165 tons/year from the SOW. However, our calculations aslo require the amount of solids (or percent water composition) as well as the amount of volatile solids in the sludge. We are unable to calculate these exact numbers, and will make assumptions for their values.\n",
        "### Sludge Dewatering System\n",
        "Based on our research and calculations, we have to choose which dewatering system will work best in the Fairmont Plant. We chose centrifuges.\n",
        "### Polymer addition\n",
        "A polymer should be added for thickening, which will vary on a number of different factors. This includes the type of centrifuge used, size of the centrifuge, the type of influent solids, ionic characteristics of the sludge, water reintroduction potential, and polymer injection point. The dosing should always be based upon lbs/ton of solids coming in, which may fluctuate. We estimate a fluctuation of about one percent, and for this report have assumed a value of 5.5% to 6.5% percent solids.\n",
        "\n",
        "The centrisys centrifuge that we picked for this project handles a lot of energy, which can cause high turbulence and speed in the machine. This requires a robust, high strength, cross length polymer that will not detach from the solids mid-process. \n",
        "\n",
        "However, it is very important to keep in mind that robust polymer tends to only accept a short window of input solids concentration fluctuations. Many problems can arise if polymer is only tested at the perfect solids concentration. If a small swign occurs in the real world, the whole process can fall apart quickly. Therefore, solids concentration should be accurately measured and tested thoroughly to ensure that the best polymer is being used. Information regarding polymer reactions to fluctuations in solids concentration can be found online and tested in the lab. An additional consideration includes observing the impact that overdosing polymer has on coagulation potential of the mix, which can help determine if that polymer would be beneficial for use on highly fluctuating inflows. \n",
        "\n",
        "Ferric sludge, which is what is being dealt with at the Fairmont plant, is easy to dewater. This lets the plant get away with using cheaper polymer as compared to traditional blends. Overall, it is important to understand the balance of requiring more polymer for cheaper varieties vs less polymer for more expensive varieties to yield similar results. City projects tend to rely on cheaper polymers, however, it is very important to do lab testing and realize the effects of differen polymers. Testing involves spinning samples in a centrifuge with different polymer types and solids concentrations.  Do testing! Spin it out in a lab centrifuge. We recommend using the centrysis company to do testing because they can use their centrifuge to directly test Fairmont sludge. Additionally, cenrisys would not actually be selling the polymer product, which ensures an unbiased suggestion, and the best possible option. Contact information for a California based worker managing these operations is listed in the Vendor Information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The volume and beach angle of the centrifuge also impacts polymer addition requirements. Every increase in volume is multiplied by an increase in the G-force of the centrifuge, creating something known as a \"G Volume\". A higher G Volume allows for the flocs to settle better, which results in a lower polymer requirement. Beach angle, or steepness, also affects volume of the centrifuge. A steeper angle allows for a higher volume, and in turn, a higher settling rate. Keeping these in mind, it is very important to note changes in centrifuge design specifications, and how polymer dosing should be altered to account for that. \n",
        "\n",
        "As usual, it is important to understand the ionic properties of the sludge, as the whole point of the polymer is to attract flocs. Always choose anionic polymers with cationic flocs, and vice versa. Another consideration includes the form of the polymer. Really large facilities tend to use dry polymer as it is comes in pure solid form and requires less storage volume and transportation costs. Emulsion polymers, on the other hand, are already absorbed into an oil or liquid, which means that they are already unraveled and ready to apply. Dry polymers need a makedown system in order to properly unravel. If this step is not considered, the polymer may not be as effective as advertised, and there should be considerations toward loss in the whole system. \n",
        "\n",
        "This brings the conversation towards considering injection points into the system. Some option inlude right before centrifuging, directly into the feed pump, in the holding tank, or even in the equalization basins. This all is determined by the type of polymer used. Fragile polymers should be fed into the solution right before the centrifuge. Robust or dry polymers need more retention time, or time to mix, and so need to be inserted earlier in the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "With water treatment plants that deal with reintriduction of dewatering liquid into the head of the plant will probably require NSF approved polymer, which drastically limits the possibilities of polymers in the plant. Since this is one of our team's main goals in the plant, this will be an important consideration.\n",

        "###Centrifuges\n",
        "After evaluating the necessary amount of centrifuges, we will choose a layout and an number of centrifuges that accomdates our design flow and allows for continued treatment even if one centrifuge malfunctions. Essentially, the number of centrifuges will be the number required plus 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sludge Handling System\n",
        "We also have to choose a strategy to handle dewatered sludge. Because it requires the least amount of extra land at the lowest cost, we chose off site dumping. Given that our goal arsenic concentration is 10 $\\mu$g/L, our sludge will not be hazardous.\n",
        "### Transportation and Storages\n",

Some of these chemicals are also referred to as filtration aids, but function the same way as coagulants. Residuals are generated as underflow discharges from the sedimentation tanks. These residuals contain source water contaminants, as well as chemicals added to aid solid removal and formulation impurities in the added treatment chemicals.\n",

From this study, it was found that gravity thickening required 0.0019-0.0021 Kwh m^-3 for plants that serve over 50,000 people, while thickening centrigues required 0.015-0.035 kWh m^-3.
