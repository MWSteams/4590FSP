        "Our design revolves around the ferric chloride coagulant and emulsion polymer quantities specified in the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant Scope of Work document. We initially attempted to calculate chemical requirements using target effluent levels and existing influent water quality data, but this was not possible due to various time and communication constraints. However, we believe that our assumption to base our design around the Scope of Work values of 4,142 tons of ferric chloride coagulant and 165 tons of emulsion polymer per year is appropriate for two main reasons: 1) It is already a conservative estimate of chemical usage as part of the preliminary annual operation and maintenance cost budgeting, 2) This data is coming in directly from the client, the Los Angeles Department of Power and Water. Furthermore, our coagulant cost estimate from vendor pricing is nearly 90% of the cost estimate outlined in the Scope of Work document. \n",
        "\n",
        "As part of our basis of design, we also used dosage information from the Cottonwood Plant as an alternative method to calculate 30-day storage volume requirements. This gave a less conservative estimate of the amount of ferric chloride coagulant needed. However, it gave an unreasonably high estimate for the polymer. This is likely because the cationic polymer used at Cottonwood has a different purpose from that at Fairmont Plant, since evaporation ponds are used instead of a residuals treatment train. Thus, this polymer dosage used at Cottonwood would not be relevant to our design.\n",
        "\n",
        "The open tank farm area that was initially proposed by the client was swapped with the truck staging area, since both are 100’ x 200’. The trucks would still be next to the waste handling site, and the chemicals would be pumped a shorter distance since the new tank farm would be located adjacent to both the rapid mix and residuals areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "Having redundancy was a crucial element to our design process. We designed the piping layout of the open tank farm such that if part of a pipe failed, it could be fixed without cutting off any chemical feed train. As there will be a maximum of 3 active rapix mix units operating at a time, we chose 6 storage tanks for the coagulant (it is also an easily divisible number). Since the residuals train only has 1 unit, we chose 2 storage tanks for the polymer – one for use, and one for backup during maintenance. There are 2 dosage lines per treatment train for further redundancy. The maximum flow rate of each line was calculated and used to size pipes and pump calibration columns for the coagulant and polymer feed systems respectively."

        "\n",
        "The Fairmont Sedimentation Plant Scope of Work document notes that two types of products will be used: a coagulant (specifically, ferric chloride) and emulsion polymer. Due to communication constraints with engineers at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, we are unlikely to fully understand the rationale behind the selection of ferric chloride as the coagulant. However, considering that it was already specified, we have decided to move forward with ferric chloride as the coagulant of choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scope of Work includes only the average dose of ferric chloride (13.14 mg/L) with no mention of the maximum or minimum. We have conservatively assumed that the maximum dose of ferric chloride will be 30 mg/L. This is slightly more than twice the average dose.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6.2. Emulsion Polymer**\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the type of emulsion polymer was not specified in the Scope of Work document (or anywhere else). There are many types and blends of polymers that are available in the water treatment market, many of which are proprietary and so we do not have information about their chemical structures. \n",
        "\n",
        "Due to limitations of this design project, we will not be able to confidently select an emulsion polymer without running bench tests. We also assumed that the polymer is used for the residuals treatment train. However, we do know that the polymer is going to be cationic, and there are multiple vendors available. We will research a few options from different vendors and select a representative emulsion polymer to provide an estimate for density and viscosity. More information about the representative polymer will be provided in the design section. \n",
        "\n",
        "## **6.3. Other Chemicals**\n",
        "\n",
        "It was noted by other teams that a high coagulant dosage could significantly alter the pH of the water. Since the Scope of Work did not specify the need for other chemical products, we made the assumption that the acid neutralizing capacity of raw water entering the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant is adequate, and that additional chemicals beyond the coagulant and emulsion polymer are not required.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6.4. Chemical Storage**\n",
        "\n",
        "As both the Cottonwood Treatment Plant and Los Angeles Aqueduct Filtration Plant use ferric chloride, we initially thought of estimating tank volume using measurement tools from Google Earth. However, this proved to be quite a challenge and perhaps not the most accurate approach since the other plants may have different treatment goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, we decided to work backwards from the annual masses of ferric chloride and emulsion polymer specified by the Scope of Work to calculate the required tank volumes, assuming that they will be stored at the highest concentration commercially available.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## **6.5. Pump Selection**\n",
        "The type of pumps will be chosen based on a broad range of flows outlined below. The [Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's water treatment training module](http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/BSDW/OperatorCertification/TrainingModules/ww07_chem_feed_wb.pdf) outlines popular chemical dosing pumps. It recommends peristaltic tube pumps for feed rates less than 0.1 gallon per hour (gph), solenoid metering pumps for feed rates between 0.1 and 10 gph, and positive displacement pumps for feed rates less than 600 gallons per hour. The maximum feed rate will help decide what pump will be appropriate.\n",
        "\n",
        "For our design, we ended up selecting a positive displacement diaphragm pump for both the coagulant feed and the polymer feed based on the maximum flow rate. This type of pump uses a flexible membrane and valves to push water through the pump chamber. The membrane stretches outward to let water into the chamber and stretches inward to displace and push the water outward. The positive displacement diaphragm pump uses a piston, plunger or diaphragm to achieve the oscillating motion. Shown below is a figure provided by [Diener Precision Pumps](https://www.dienerprecisionpumps.com/en/positive-displacement-pumps.html) of the pumping mechanism.\n",

In order to maintain system accuracy, it is important to perform periodic checks of the flow rates and recalibrate the pumps as necessary. A simple calibration column can be used for this purpose. The amount of time it takes for the solution to fill up from the zero mark on the column to the fill mark can be divided from the volume of the column to obtain a flow rate through that pump.

This may be because high concentrations of coagulant can have high viscosity and density. Our team has opted not to dilute the coagulant. We assume that since the flow is turbulent the viscosity will not have a large impact on the feed system design. Even so, the code for the coagulant is written so that if the client ultimately wanted to dilute the solution, the code could easily be adjusted. For this reason, there is a differentiation between 1) the stock pipes - the flow coming directly out of the tank farm, and 2) the feed pipes - the pipes feeding into the rapid mix unit in the design code. These pipes are labeled in the coagulant pipe design schematic. For our design the feed pipes and stock pipes have the same properties; however, this could be changed by changing the properties of the feed solution (active strength, density, etc.). For reference, select diluted properties of ferric chloride are provided in a table in the appendix below (adapted from Dow Chemical's ferric chloride bulletin (1965)). The code indicates where these properties should be changed if dilution is deemed necessary."
