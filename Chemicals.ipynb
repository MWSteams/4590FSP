This will include determining the coagulant and polymer dosage, conducting a cost analysis based on anticipated dosages and vendors, and designing chemical storage. These tasks require a determination of the chemical feeds, feed hydraulics and plumbing, and available vendors. Additionally, our storage system design will include the number of storage tanks, tank size, location, footprint, and safety add-ons in order to meet OSHA requirements (e.g. spillover capture, eye washes, safety showers). Information will be primarily sourced from government regulations, Fairmont Treatment plant SOW, relevant vendors, and similar go-by systems.  "
