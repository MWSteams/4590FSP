        "\n",
        "The Fairmont Sedimentation Plant Scope of Work Document notes that two types of products will be used: a coagulant (specifically, ferric chloride) and emulsion polymer. Due to communication constraints with engineers at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, we are unlikely to fully understand the rationale behind the selection of ferric chloride as the coagulant. However, considering that it was already specified, we have decided to move forward with ferric chloride as the coagulant of choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Scope of Work includes only the average dose of ferric chloride (13.14 mg/L) with no mention of the maximum or minimum. We have conservatively assumed that the maximum dose of ferric chloride will be 30 mg/L. This is slightly more than twice the average dose.\n",

        "## **6.2. Emulsion Polymer**\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the type of emulsion polymer was not specified in the Scope of Work document. There are many types and blends of polymers that are available in the water treatment market, many of which are proprietary and we do not have information about their chemical structures. \n",
        "\n",
        "Due to limitations of this design project, we will not be able to confidently select an emulsion polymer without bench testing capabilities. However, we do know that the polymer is going to be cationic, and there are multiple vendors available. We will research a few options from different vendors and select a representative emulsion polymer to provide an estimate for density, and viscosity. More information about the representative polymer will be provided in the design section. \n",
        "\n",
        "## **6.3. Other Chemicals**\n",
        "\n",
        "It was noted by other teams that a high coagulant dosage could significantly alter the pH of the water. Since the Scope of Work did not specify the need for other chemical products, we made the assumption that the acid neutralizing capacity of raw water entering the Fairmont Sedimentation Plant is adequate, and that additional chemicals beyond the coagulant and emulsion polymer are not required.\n",

However, this proved to be quite a challenge and perhaps not the most accurate approach since the other plants may have different treatment goals.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, we decided to work backwards from the annual masses of ferric chloride and emulsion polymer used specified by the Scope of Work to calculate the required tank volumes, assuming that they will be stored at the highest concentration commercially available.\n",

        "\n",

The [Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's water treatment training module](http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/BSDW/OperatorCertification/TrainingModules/ww07_chem_feed_wb.pdf) outlines popular chemical dosing pumps. It recommends peristaltic (tube) pumps for feed rates less than 0.1 gallon per hour (gph), Solenoid metering pumps for feed rates between 0.1 and 10 gph, and positive displacement pumps for feed rates less than 600 gallons per hour. The maximum feed rate will help decide what pump will be appropriate.\n",

        "For our design, we have selected a positive displacement diaphragm pump for the coagulant feed and a solenoid metering pump for the polymer feed based on the differences in feed rates. Both pump types use a flexible membrane and valves to push water through the pump chamber. The membrane stretches outward to let water into the chamber and stretches inward to displace and push the water outward. While the positive displacement diaphragm pump uses a piston, plunger or diaphragm to achieve the oscillating motion. The solenoid metering pump uses an electromagnet.

In order to maintain system accuracy, it is important to perform periodic checks of the flow rates and recalibrate the pumps as necessary. A simple calibration column can be used for this purpose, and the amount of time it takes for the solution to fill up from the zero mark on the column to the fill mark can be divided from the volume of the column to obtain a flow rate through that pump.
